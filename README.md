# Oshop

This project is a fictitious web shop that I created while finishing [this excellent Angular course](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-angular-master-class). It allows me to apply the knowledge learned during the course. The app's front-end is made with Angular 7, it is serverless and uses Firebase as its real-time database.

I started coding this project along with the teacher, and then quickly decided to continue developping it on my own, because there were too many differences between my code and the teacher's code. Then, I only used the introduction video of each section as requirements of what should be built. Here's the list of differences:

- Using Angular 7 instead of 4
- Using AngularFire XX instead of XX
- Ditched Bootstrap in favor of Angular Material
- Refactored the Firebase services to be more object oriented
- Most of the code is different now, as I'm not watching the course anymore

The app is (manually) deployed to Firebase hosting on https://oshop-b85ea.web.app

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.1.1.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
